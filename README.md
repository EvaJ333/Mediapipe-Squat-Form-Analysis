# Mediapipe-Squat-Form-Analysis
Mediapipe Pose impliments machine learning, providing an open source framwework that allows for high-fidelity body pose tracking using a two-step detection-tracking pipeline:
1. Detector: Locates the person or pose region-of-interest (ROI) within the frame
2. Tracker: Uses the cropped ROI frame as input to predict the pose landmarks and segmentation mask
These features can be applied to analyze squat form. This is benificial because it is a very specific and often high-risk excerice when performed with heavy weight.
This program will consider knee and hip angles to accesses squat form:
